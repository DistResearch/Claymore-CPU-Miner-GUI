#GUI for Claymore CPU Miner
**Compiled binary available [here](https://github.com/stasuss/Claymore-CPU-Miner-GUI/releases) (including latest miner version)**

**don't forget to give this launcher admin rights in windows, so it can launch miner in privileged mode for fullspeed**

*requires .net 4.0 or higher*


**features:**
* can start miltiple processes with individual settings
* can control priority of each started process
* can hide/show console window for each process
* while miner uses some strange text output, my launcher reads logs to determine hashrate
* shows summ of hashrate of all processes
* shows cute chart of total hashrate variations (makes it easy to experiment with settings)
* pool list
* created empty if there is none
* and it is rearrangable
* that's all folks =)

* App tries to delete previous log on startup, if they are locked, it fails =)
* No fool-proof-protection. Any input accepted and may crach the app =)
* No precise hashrate calculations
* No refactoring and no optimisations =) sorry =)
