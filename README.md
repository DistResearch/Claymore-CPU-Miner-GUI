#GUI for Claymore CPU Miner
**Compiled binary available [here](https://github.com/stasuss/Claymore-CPU-Miner-GUI/releases) (including latest miner version)**

**don't forget to give this launcher admin rights in windows, so it can launch miner in privileged mode for fullspeed**

*requires .net 4.0 or higher*

* App tries to delete previous log on startup, if they are locked, it fails =)
* No fool-proof-protection. Any input accepted and may crach the app =)
* No precise hashrate calculations
* No refactoring and no optimisations =) sorry =)
